Solving Organizational Hierarchy using Python

1. To solve Organizational Hierarchy I have used Pyvis package. To me, Org hierarchy is just another manifestation of nodes and edges which form the basis of network      analysis
2. In any type/kind of org hierarchy number of nodes will always be equal to number of people in the organizational. 
3. Edges represent relationships among people. Some relationships will be one to many (dotted relationships) , many to one, one to one (employee-manager relationship)    ,orpahned ( individual contributor), etc.

Please let me know if you see any issues in my code or suggestions to improve the relationship.
